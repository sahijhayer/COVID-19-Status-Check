# COVID-19-Status-Check
Created using HTML, CSS (with BootStrap), and JavaScript (Chart.js library)
Design of a web-app which displays the situation of COVID-19 in the user's inputted country. The stats of confirmed cases, active cases, recovered cases, and deaths are all plotted onto a graph with cases vs. time, and the live count of each statistic is shown as well.

PS. Some countries' (ie. Canada and the UK) statistics are false due to the API having wrong numbers, not as a result of my code.
